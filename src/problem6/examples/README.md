# Example Implementation Files

These files are provided as **reference examples** for the backend engineering team. They are not meant to be compiled or run directly, but rather to illustrate the expected implementation patterns.

## Files Included

- **interfaces.ts** - TypeScript type definitions and interfaces
- **validation-service.ts** - Example validation logic with anomaly detection
- **websocket-handler.ts** - Example WebSocket implementation using Socket.io

## Note

These files may reference packages that are not installed in this project (e.g., `socket.io`, `jsonwebtoken`). They are documentation artifacts to guide the implementation team and should be adapted to your specific technology stack and requirements.

When implementing, ensure you:
1. Install all required dependencies
2. Adapt the code to your specific architecture
3. Add proper error handling and logging
4. Include comprehensive tests
